          <p>
          Hi all, I am Devyn Bailey. I am a full stack web developer with a certification from the University of Denver. I also hold a Bachelorâ€™s of Science degree in Biology. During my time in college I held 1-2 jobs to pay my way through, building over 10+ years of customer service experience. While attending the bootcamp I also held a full time job on top of being a parent. Being able to stay organized, multitask and roll with the flow are some of my top abilities. I am a firm believer in being a team player and collaboration, with a strong knack for interpersonal relationships. Currently I am looking to join an amazing company and team where I can not only be an asset to the company but also further expand my information technology skills.
